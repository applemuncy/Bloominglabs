Arduino sketch for the OpenAccess board.

Note well that the password in here should be changed and must be identical to the one used by the 'twistd daemon'

Revising Steves code back to a minimun at the door system.
Edge computing is all the, rage don't you know?

Anyway, the plan, is to have a AG150 box networked by wire and/or WiFi,
with a single Arduino UNO connected by USB running this code.

The UNO will connect to the RFID reader with opto isolation.

And control the latch through a monolithic relay. 
On reading a valid RFID, it will check the EEPROM DB.

If found and the mask is not zero or 0xff then pop the door open.
Then sending event information to the AG150.

If not found, notify AG150 of the RFID number.
